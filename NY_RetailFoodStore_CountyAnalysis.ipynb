Unless you know New York's Sanitary Inspection Guidelines by heart, you don't know what each deficiency number specifically means or if it's a critical deficiency or not. After doing some research, I found this [pdf](https://agriculture.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/03/sanitary_inspection_guidelines_fsi-890.pdf) online that gave further explanation into what each deficiency number meant. I wanted to incorprate it with the existing data set so I manually input the values from the pdf into Excel, saved the workbook as a CSV file, and imported it into my personal database."
